# About

The liquidation bot monitors the Chia blockchain for whether CircuitDAO loans are insufficiently collateralized. If they are, the bot will trigger the liquidation of the collateral backing the loan, and bid in the subsequent liquidation auction.

# Installation

Install the liquidation bot

```pipx install liquidation-bot```

# Quick start

Once installed, run the bot from the command line

```liquidation-bot```
